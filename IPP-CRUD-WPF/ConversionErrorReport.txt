Conversion Error Report (Created 11/2/2017 6:50:04 AM UTC)

Every time a possible conversion problem is located, the file name, problem severity , and problem description are recorded. There are three levels of severity:

	Warning	= code will convert and will likely work, but conversion may need manual improvement
	Minor	= code will convert, but it will likely need manual correction to work
	Major	= code will not convert. It must be modified before used with converter

There are also general issues to remember when converting web sites:
	- Events connected with the Handles syntax in VB will not work in C#. Events must be connected in code or in the control markup.
	- Any VB/C# in your ASPX markup cannot be automatically converted. You must convert this manually or convert the code in chunks using the normal Code Converter.
	- The page language and code file references in ASPX files need to be changed the page language changes.
	- AssemblyInfo classes cannot be automatically converted. These must be manually updated.
